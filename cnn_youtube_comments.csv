IBM had 2 products. It was early, early days in VR/SR. Radiology and Legal. I talked to someone who told me the true/not true story - you decide. So Stanley Kubrick had this friend who worked for IBM and wanted him to come and be the  technical support for HAL a large character in the story.

If you want not face the 7 year tribulation here what you must do. 1. Believe Jesus died for all your sins, by shedding his blood for you on the cross, past, present and future and after three days rose from the dead. 2. Admit your sinner a you need him. 3. Pray to him on both step 1 and 2, then part you repent on his finished work and blood, for the blood what get you clean on the inside. you will be SEALED till the day of redemption an can not lose your salvation for no one can gain or earn it, its a free gift. The alternative to not accepting is the 7 year tribulation, gods judgement and trail of the left behind. Where normal life is gone an be hell on earth. 21 wraiths are place on this earths. the 7 seals, the 7 trumpets, and the 7 vials/bowels (base on translation). Some will be know ones like oceans a rivers turning to red blood and the antichrist kingdom into darkness like pharaohs in exodus. There be new like the scorpion like creature coming out of hell wearing crown to touture all who do not have gods seal (tribulation saints) for five months and you won’t die either. There be two witness who will sent plagues and harm on earth. The dragon, the beast, and false prophet are the satanic trinity. Where they will force you to take the mark of the beast which on right hand or forehead. Do not take this or it will be dam to the lake of fire. But Lucifer will cut your head for refusing to take the mark, all may be martyr. Yes Lucifer the evil one will rule for 7 years and force people rich an poor to worship him attack those who apose his rule even he will trick all to see he is the messiah. Jesus will return at the end of the 7 tribulation with us saints to put Lucifer into the pit and Jesus rule 1000 years. The non believer will be judge a your nam not on book of life, cast to lake of fire, aplace forever seperated from God and eternal torment. Soon there be new earth, heaven, were god will live with us forever an all evil a suffering is gone. Please accept christ into your heart. God love you so much more then even you own family he want to help you a save you. Give him a chance and trust me you won’t regret it. He has build a place for you in heaven. Soon ww3 after the rapture and Major events will happen but do not fear if you believe Jesus is with you an he got you. i pray you repent an come with us to heaven, for heaven is place beyond are understanding and grander then normal life down here. bless you and thank god for your time in reading this an info here is in the bible mosty in book of revelations and pauls letters. You should also read Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, jonah, Hosea, joel, amos, Nahum, Obadiah, Jeremiah and the gosiples matthew, mark, luke and john. god want to you to come to him as your self, speak to him honestly and with love n you see the truth.

6Z7RYFxxsEk,@lynnejamieson2063,"I’m not really sure that anyone should be stating categorically if a particular era was easier or more difficult unless they were being directly affected in both eras. I doubt very much that George Clooney was personally affected by McCarthyism, seeing as how he wasn’t born during the peak McCarthy era and I doubt that he will feel a great deal of personal impact now. I don’t doubt that he will be involved in humanitarian work currently and have every faith that his wife his working had but at the end of the day they can close the door to their home and feel pretty safe. 

Today’s issues to him just seem more pervasive because McCarthyism issues have always just been stories from the past, even if they were from and of people that he knew but of course today’s issues are more pervasive because they’re current and uncertain. No-one knows if this is the full extent or if things will only become worse. 

But as someone who does not live in the US and hasn’t any relatives there, the current issues and McCarthyism don’t feel too dissimilar. They both feel like a weird kind of tunnel vision, knee jerk reaction, I don’t know what I’m doing so I’m going to make the population scared of everything and become even more insular sort of thing, that is almost synonymous with the US. 

The only difference is, that we don’t know just how far Trump is going to go yet. Will the Dems be able to regain some much needed control at the midterms then start seeking impeachments for both the president and the vp with the hopes of putting a Democratic Speaker of the House in the White House? Who knows, but let’s face it, there’s never been a successful impeachment but then they also say third time lucky. Regardless of any of that daydreaming though, there is still a year and a half to go before the midterms and the Democrats need to find some decent candidates that are looking to shake things up and are actually looking to fight for the rights of the working people of the US, they need more like AOC, Bernie, Mayor Pete etc (but especially Bernie, many of us in the UK have a big soft spot for Bernie), who genuinely just want to make life a little easier for the average person instead of the wealthy…then maybe there could be an overhaul in how long campaigns are allowed to run for, how much money can be spent on them, time limits and equality in publicity, money and gifts connected with lobbying etc etc",0,2025-06-04T10:18:12Z

mOXZMksDHSw,@shipwreck8847,"This is so stupid, so what are the democrats trying to get the point across to encourage trump to stand firm with the tariffs?  I would rather him walk it back than go through with them.  This is exactly why democrats always shoot themselves in the foot.  You're mocking him for something most of the country actually wants.  We want him to walk back on the tariffs.  I don't want him to go forward with it.  Dumbsh*ts on the democratic party. And this is coming from a democrat.",0,2025-06-04T05:00:05Z
